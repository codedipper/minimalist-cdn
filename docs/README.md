# Minimalistic CDN
## About
A minimalistic CDN that can simply upload, delete and show files.
## Inspiration
[A repo](https://github.com/Xcyth/Simple-CDN) made by Xcyth started this.\
When I looked at the code, there were so many security holes and I got mad.\
So here's my recreation! Hope you like it.
## Requirements
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)\
[Npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) (Usually comes with Node.)\
Rename `./config-example.js` to `./config.js` and fill it in.\
`npm install`\
`npm start`
